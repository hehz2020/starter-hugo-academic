I﻿'m a senior undergraduate student at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University.  I will be a phd student in the Department of Statistics at UCLA soon. At PKU, I'm very fortunate to do my Bachelor thesis under the supervision of Prof. Wei Lin. At my undergraduate study, I'm also very fortunate to have worked with Prof. Xiaowu Dai and Prof. Weijie Su. I also work closely with Puheng Li at PKU.
